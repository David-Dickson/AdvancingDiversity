# Advancing Diversity

The Institute to Advance Diversity connects underrepresented minorities with mentorship for career advancement. The Institute to Advance Diversity's code is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I will only provide code snippets of my contribution. This repository contains MS SQL tables and stored procs, C#/.NET Core Models, Services, Interfaces, Dependency Injection, and Controllers that I've implemented.
